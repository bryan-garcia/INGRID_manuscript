\subsection{Construction of grids}
Grids are generated directly from a Patch map and exported in the standard UEDGE gridue file format. INGRID employs a ``divide and conquer" approach to grid generation by delegating local grid generation to each individual Patch within the Patch map. That is, each Patch is responsible for generating a ``subgrid" for the region of the computational domain it represents. INGRID is capable of supporting a variety of divertor configurations by generating a grid with this ``divide and conquer" approach. 
Users can specify the number of grid cells in the poloidal direction (np) and radial direction (nr) for each Patch individually so long as the choices are index-space consistent.
