\subsection{Calculation of reference points}

The topology of magnetic flux surfaces in tokamak edge plasma is
defined by relative positions of X-points and the magnetic axis. These
key reference points are calculated in INGRID by finding nulls of the
poloidal field, solving the equation

\beq
(\Psi_R)^2 + (\Psi_Z)^2 = 0
\eeq

For finging the correct root of this equation the solver needs an
accurate initial guess; the user is supposed to provide initial guess
for the magnetic axis and for one or two of those X-points that are
expected to be included in the domain.
