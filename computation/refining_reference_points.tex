\subsection{Refining reference points}
 INGRID computes high-accuracy $(r, z)$ coordinates for the magnetic-axis and x-points of interest based off the user's initial $(r, z)$ guess. Since the magnetic-axis and x-points locally represent a paraboloid and hyperbolic-paraboloid respectively, ``refined" $(r, z)$ coordinates for the magnetic-axis and x-points can be obtained by applying a root-finder to the gradient of the psi-function obtained from interpolated EFIT data. The initial guess for the root-finder is provided either via the INGRID parameter file or via command-line when not operating in GUI mode. These refined reference points are essential to key steps of the INGRID algorithm such as computing normalized psi-data, topology analysis, line-tracing, and exporting of gridue. Refinement of topological reference points occurs automatically via GUI mode, but users are able to update entries interactively and on the fly should discrepancies be seen in the plot of EFIT data.
