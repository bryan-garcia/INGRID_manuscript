abstract = "A computer code is described which automatically generates a structured curvilinear quasi-orthogonal mesh of the type used in several models of transport for the edge and divertor regions in tokamak fusion experiments. The method considered works from numerically generated equilibria and from digitized parametrisations of structures and boundaries in the simulation domain. It therefore produces realistic computational meshes which allow comparisons between simulation results and experiments. The method is well adapted to the generation of meshes for a number of interesting magnetic field topologies, such as single null, connected and disconnected double null divertor geometries."

abstract = "A new modular code called BOUT++ is presented, which simulates 3D fluid equations in curvilinear coordinates. Although aimed at simulating Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) in tokamak x-point geometry, the code is able to simulate a wide range of fluid models (magnetised and unmagnetised) involving an arbitrary number of scalar and vector fields, in a wide range of geometries. Time evolution is fully implicit, and 3rd-order WENO schemes are implemented. Benchmarks are presented for linear and non-linear problems (the Orszag–Tang vortex) showing good agreement. Performance of the code is tested by scaling with problem size and processor number, showing efficient scaling to thousands of processors. Linear initial-value simulations of ELMs using reduced ideal MHD are presented, and the results compared to the ELITE linear MHD eigenvalue code. The resulting mode-structures and growth-rate are found to be in good agreement (γBOUT++=0.245ωA, γELITE=0.239ωA, with Alfvénic timescale 1/ωA=R/VA). To our knowledge, this is the first time dissipationless, initial-value simulations of ELMs have been successfully demonstrated."

	abstract = {The power-law series for the poloidal magnetic flux function, up to the third-order terms, is presented for the case where two nulls of the poloidal magnetic field are separated by a small distance, as in a snowflake divertor. Distinct from the earlier results, no assumptions about the field symmetry are made. Conditions for the realization of an exact snowflake are expressed in terms of the coefficients of the power series. It is shown that, by a proper choice of the coordinate frame in the poloidal plane, one can obtain efficient similarity solutions for the separatrices and flux surfaces in the divertor region: the whole variety of flux surface shapes can be characterized by a single dimensionless parameter. Transition from a snowflake-minus to a snowflake-plus configuration in the case of no particular symmetry is described. The effect of the finite toroidal current density in the divertor region is assessed for the case of no particular symmetry.}

	title = {Integrated modeling applications for tokamak experiments with {OMFIT}},
	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {One modeling framework for integrated tasks (OMFIT) is a comprehensive integrated modeling framework which has been developed to enable physics codes to interact in complicated workflows, and support scientists at all stages of the modeling cycle. The OMFIT development follows a unique bottom-up approach, where the framework design and capabilities organically evolve to support progressive integration of the components that are required to accomplish physics goals of increasing complexity. OMFIT provides a workflow for easily generating full kinetic equilibrium reconstructions that are constrained by magnetic and motional Stark effect measurements, and kinetic profile information that includes fast-ion pressure modeled by a transport code. It was found that magnetic measurements can be used to quantify the amount of anomalous fast-ion diffusion that is present in DIII-D discharges, and provide an estimate that is consistent with what would be needed for transport simulations to match the measured neutron rates. OMFIT was used to streamline edge-stability analyses, and evaluate the effect of resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) on the pedestal stability, which have been found to be consistent with the experimental observations. The development of a five-dimensional numerical fluid model for estimating the effects of the interaction between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and microturbulence, and its systematic verification against analytic models was also supported by the framework. OMFIT was used for optimizing an innovative high-harmonic fast wave system proposed for DIII-D. For a parallel refractive index , the conditions for strong electron-Landau damping were found to be independent of launched  and poloidal angle. OMFIT has been the platform of choice for developing a neural-network based approach to efficiently perform a non-linear multivariate regression of local transport fluxes as a function of local dimensionless parameters. Transport predictions for thousands of DIII-D discharges showed excellent agreement with the power balance calculations across the whole plasma radius and over a broad range of operating regimes. Concerning predictive transport simulations, the framework made possible the design and automation of a workflow that enables self-consistent predictions of kinetic profiles and the plasma equilibrium. It is found that the feedback between the transport fluxes and plasma equilibrium can significantly affect the kinetic profiles predictions. Such a rich set of results provide tangible evidence of how bottom-up approaches can potentially provide a fast track to integrated modeling solutions that are functional, cost-effective, and in sync with the research effort of the community.}
