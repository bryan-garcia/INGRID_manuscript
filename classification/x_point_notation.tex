\subsection{\label{sec:level2}N-S-E-W notation}
In this section we detail INGRID's approach to analysis of x-points. The user begins by specifying the number of x-points INGRID should take into consideration. INGRID takes this information to determine which identification scheme to utilize. In all cases, however, INGRID defines a notion of ``North" (N), ``South" (S), ``East" (E), and ``West" (W) directions for each x-point. By defining these N-S-E-W directions, INGRID can identify the divertor configuration within the EFIT data. We utilize a specific method of assigning N-S-E-W directions depending on which x-point we are analyzing (i.e. primary x-point or secondary x-point).
