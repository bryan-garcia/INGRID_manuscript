\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Summary}
In this report, we introduced INGRID as a grid generator capable of producing UEDGE ready gridue files for single-null (SNL), unbalanced double-null (UDN), and snowflake (SF) configurations. INGRID can be utilized via the INGRID Python package, or through a parameter file driven GUI mode. We discussed how the adoption of a local N-S-E-W convention at x-points paves the way for INGRID's the ability to identify the divertor configuration embedded within the EFIT data. This identification step in turn allows for INGRID's creation of our Patch map abstraction. From this Patch map, the user finally produces a grid ready for export in UEDGE gridue format. Testing of INGRID against the internal grid generator in UEDGE was conducted on an SF75 configuration. These tests illustrated Ingrid's ability to both reproduce a grid obtained with UEDGE's internal grid generator and produce consistent UEDGE simulation results, but at a fraction of the effort with regards to obtaining a gridue file. The first public release of INGRID is now available with documentation and tutorials for new users of the code.
