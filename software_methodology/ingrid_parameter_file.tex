\subsection{\label{sec:level2}INGRID parameter file}
INGRID has been designed to be controlled from a single
configuration/parameter file when operating in GUI mode. We have
decided to use YAML formatted files for the parameter
file\cite{PyYAML}. This YAML file is similar to the familiar Fortran
namelist files due to the key-value structure it is based off of. YAML
is in an easy to read format that has extensive support within
Python. With the PyYAML library, Python reads a YAML formatted file
and internally represents it as a Python dictionary. This allows users
to model cases in the INGRID GUI and reuse a parameter file in
scripting for later usage (e.g. batch grid generation). Some key
controls within the parameter file include: EFIT file specification,
specification of number of X-points, approximate coordinates of
X-point(s) of interest, approximate magnetic-axis coordinates, psi
level values, and target plate settings (files,
transformations). Other controls in the parameter file include: path
specification for data files, grid cell np/nr values, poloidal and
radial grid transformation settings, limiter specific settings,
saving/loading of Patch maps, gridue settings, and debug
settings. This is not an exhaustive list. Further details can be found
in INGRID's Read The Docs online documentation.
