\subsection{\label{sec:level2}Report organization}
This report is organized into five sections. Section II contains a discussion on the classification of equilibria and nomenclature that arises when discussing magnetic-topologies with multiple X-points. 
In section III, INGRID's computational algorithm is discussed. Here core design choices that arise in interpolation methods, topology analysis, domain decomposition, and grid generations are detailed. Section IV provides a demonstration of INGRID capabilities by illustrating performance of grid generation as well as benchmarking against the internal UEDGE grid generator. Finally, closing remarks are made in section V.
