\noindent We present INGRID: a novel, Python based, interactive grid generator for edge plasma modeling in magnetic fusion devices. INGRID is capable of automatically generating grids for single-null (SNL), unbalanced double-null (UDN), and snowflake (SF) tokamak configurations. Users can generate grids via a parameter-file driven GUI, or through direct utilization of the INGRID Python package. We discuss the INGRID workflow that consists of three phases:  analysis of provided data files for identification of the magnetic configuration, creation of a ``Patch Map" via line tracing methods, and refinement of the ``Patch Map" into a grid ready for export. We benchmark INGRID against the UEDGE internal grid generator and present the results for the considered SF-75 case. Our results demonstrate INGRID's capability to produce grids comparable to those from the internal grid generator in UEDGE in both a robust and user-friendly way.
