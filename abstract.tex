A new grid generator for tokamak boundary plasma INGRID (Interactive
Grid Generator) is a Python-based code for calculating grids for
boundary plasma modeling, for variety of configurations with one or
two X-points in the domain. Based on a given geometry of the magnetic
field, INGRID first calculates a skeleton grid which consists of a
small number of quadrilateral patches, then it puts a subgrid on each
of the patches, and joins them in a global grid. This ``divide and
conquer'' strategy allows treating in a uniform way a variety of
configurations with one or two X-points in the domain.  This includes
single-null, double-null, and variety of configurations topologically
equivalent to snowflake-plus or snowflake-minus configurations. INGRID
design allows generating grids either interactively via a
parameter-file driven GUI, or using a non-interactive
script-controlled workflow. Results of testing demonstrate that INGRID
is a flexible, robust, and user-friendly grid generation tool for
tokamak boundary plasma modeling.
