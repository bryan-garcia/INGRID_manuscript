\noindent A new grid generator for tokamak boundary plasma is
presented. INGRID (Interactive grid generator) is a Python-based code
that can generate grids for boundary plasma modeling for variety of
configurations with one or two X-points in the domain. This includes
single-null, double-null, and variety of topologically near-snowflake configurations. Users can generate grids through utilization of the INGRID Python package: either interactively via a parameter-file driven
GUI, or by embedding in a non-interactive script-controlled workflow. The INGRID workflow consists of three phases: (i) import of magnetic field
data and analysis of the magnetic configuration, (ii) creation of a
skeleton grid (“Patch Map") via line tracing method, and (iii)
refinement of the prototypical grid into a final grid.  Performance of
INGRID is analyzed by comparison with an existing grid generator. The
results demonstrate INGRID’s capability to produce grids for boundary
plasma modeling in a robust and user-friendly way.
